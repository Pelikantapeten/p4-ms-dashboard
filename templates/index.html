        <p>MDash is a tool for mentors to handle interactions between students and themselves. The purpose of MDash is to let mentors keep track of their interactions with their students and also offer a way of sharing certain information with course administrators.</p>
        <p>MDash was developed as a project for Code Institutes Full Stack Program and therefore their mentor model was used as a baseline for the project.</p>
        <p>MDash is currently in an MVP stage for assessment and testing. If access is needed or wanted, please contact <strong>mats.simonsson@sweora.se</strong> with a request.</p>
        <p>Please be sure to visit us on our social media channels for further information in regards of the development of MDash.</p>
